# reputation-engine
The reputation engine for Sadaiv's Developer Identity.

The Reputation Engine is based on our research, that you can read [here](https://docs.sadaiv.io/sadaiv-stack/reputation-engine).

It utilses the GitHub APIs to fetch data, and compute it based on the formulas mentioned in the documents and issue credentials to developers using Polygon ID.
